## by Long Le Trung (Brian)

## Dataset

Provide an overview of the dataset used, focusing on its source, content, and any initial steps taken for data cleaning or transformation. For instance:

Source: The dataset originates from Ford GoBike's bike-sharing system data.

Content: It contains information on bike trips, including trip duration, start and end times, station details, user demographics (age, gender, user type), and trip distances.

Data Wrangling: Outline any cleaning or transformations performed, such as converting date formats, calculating trip distances using latitude and longitude, and creating new columns like age groups or hourly distribution of trips.

## Summary of Findings

This section should summarize the key insights gained from the data exploration and visualizations. Here are some possible findings based on the analysis conducted:

Trip Duration Trends: Average trip durations were consistent across age groups, with minor variations.
Peak Usage Times: Rides peaked around typical commuting hours (morning and evening), indicating strong use for daily commutes.
Distance Patterns: Most trips were short distances, with a high frequency of rides under a certain distance threshold (e.g., 2-3 kilometers).
User Type Differences: Subscribers were more prevalent and exhibited different usage behaviors compared to occasional customers, such as shorter average trip durations.
Demographic Insights: Age distribution and trip behaviors varied slightly by user type and gender.

## Key Insights for Presentation

In this section, choose one or two main threads that stand out as the most impactful or relevant for presenting. Some possible focal points:

Peak Times and Commuting Behavior:

Highlight the peak times during the day, showing that the bike-sharing service aligns well with commuting hours, which can be crucial for urban mobility strategies.
Trip Distance and User Behavior:

Discuss the trend of short-distance rides, which emphasizes the bike-sharing systemâ€™s role in first-mile and last-mile transportation within the city.
Subscriber vs. Customer Usage Patterns:

Showcase differences in behavior between regular subscribers and casual customers, such as trip duration and frequency, to suggest possible marketing or engagement strategies for the service.
Each of these sections will help create a cohesive narrative that presents the data clearly and effectively for your audience. Let me know if you'd like more specific content for any of these sections.
